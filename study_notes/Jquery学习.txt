1. a document ready function

<script script >
  $(document).ready(function() {

  });
</script>

2. all JQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator,or as bling
JQuery often selects an HTML with a selector, then does something to that element.
such as :  $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
           $("button").removeClass("animated bounce");
           $(#button1").addClass("animated bounce");


3.jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.
such as : $("button").prop("disabled", true);

4.jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. 
Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.
such as : $("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");

5.jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely

6.jQuery has a function called appendTo() that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.
For example, if we wanted to move target4 from our right well to our left well, we would use:
$("#target4").appendTo("#left-well");

7.jQuery has a function called clone() that makes a copy of an element.
For example, if we wanted to copy target2 from our left-well to our right-well, we would use:
$("#target2").clone().appendTo("#right-well");

8.jQuery has a function called parent() that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected.

9.jQuery has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.

10.jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. The target:nth-child(n) CSS selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.
Here's how you would give the third element in each well the bounce class:
$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");

11.You can also target elements based on their positions using :odd or :even selectors.
$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");

12.jQuery can target the body element as well.how we would make the entire body fade out:
$("body").addClass("animated fadeOut");
